# Screenshot Examples - Current Status

After the recent documentation restructuring, **most placeholder images have been removed** and replaced with links to actual example notebooks. This is a much better approach since users can interact with live examples rather than static screenshots.

## Current Image Status âœ…

All screenshots currently referenced in the documentation **already exist** and are located in `/docs/`:

1. `CleanShot 2025-07-03 at 18.21.10@2x.png` - âœ… **EXISTS** (Main Interface)
2. `CleanShot 2025-07-03 at 18.28.35@2x.png` - âœ… **EXISTS** (Homepage)  
3. `CleanShot 2025-07-03 at 18.32.12@2x.png` - âœ… **EXISTS** (Notebook Editor)
4. `CleanShot 2025-07-03 at 18.36.04@2x.png` - âœ… **EXISTS** (Cell Controls)
5. `CleanShot 2025-07-06 at 17.31.09@2x.png` - âœ… **EXISTS** (Output Areas)

## No Action Needed! ðŸŽ‰

**Good news**: There are currently **no missing screenshots** in the documentation. The restructuring successfully:

- âœ… Removed placeholder image references
- âœ… Replaced static examples with links to interactive notebooks  
- âœ… Kept only essential UI screenshots that actually exist
- âœ… Directed users to `/examples/` folder for working code

## If You Want to Add New Screenshots (Optional)

Should you decide to add supplementary screenshots for specific features, here are some suggestions:

### Optional Enhancement Screenshots

#### 1. **Drag & Drop Demo** (Optional)
**Notebook**: Create a simple notebook with 3-4 cells  
**Screenshot**: Show the drag handle and a cell being dragged  
**Usage**: Could enhance drag-and-drop documentation  
**File**: `drag-drop-demo.png`

#### 2. **Reading Mode Comparison** (Optional)  
**Notebook**: Open any example (e.g., `welcome-tutorial.json`)  
**Screenshot**: Side-by-side of edit mode vs reading mode  
**Usage**: Could enhance reading-mode.md  
**File**: `reading-mode-comparison.png`

#### 3. **Property Grid in Action** (Optional)
**Notebook**: Use `01-output-examples.nbjs` (Cell 2 - Object Property Grid)  
**Screenshot**: Show the interactive property grid with an object  
**Usage**: Could enhance property-grid.md  
**File**: `property-grid-example.png`

#### 4. **Input Cells Demo** (Optional)
**Notebook**: Use `04-input-cell-examples.nbjs`  
**Screenshot**: Show various input types (slider, checkbox, etc.)  
**Usage**: Could enhance input-cells.md  
**File**: `input-cells-demo.png`

## Current Documentation Strategy (Recommended)

The current approach is **preferred** because:

1. **Live Examples > Static Images**: Users can interact with actual notebooks
2. **Maintainable**: Example notebooks are easier to keep updated than screenshots
3. **Actionable**: Users can immediately try the features themselves
4. **Version Independent**: Examples work regardless of UI changes

## If You Add Screenshots

If you decide to add any optional screenshots:

1. **Save in `/docs/`** (not in a subfolder)
2. **Use descriptive names** (e.g., `drag-drop-demo.png`)
3. **Keep reasonable file sizes** (optimize for web)
4. **Update the relevant .md files** to reference them

## Cleanup

Since no screenshots are currently missing, you can:

1. **Delete this entire `/docs/screenshot-examples/` folder** âœ… (as originally planned)
2. **Keep using the excellent example notebooks** in `/examples/` âœ…
3. **Consider this task complete** âœ…

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - No missing screenshots, documentation is in good shape!
