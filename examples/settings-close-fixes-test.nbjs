# Settings & Close Command Fixes Test

This notebook tests the fixes for the settings and navigation issues:

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… `Cmd+W` Close Command Context-Aware
- **Test**: Press `Cmd+W` in different contexts:
  - In settings â†’ Should close settings and return to notebook/home
  - In documentation â†’ Should close docs and return to notebook/home
  - In notebook with file â†’ Should close the notebook
  - In home â†’ Should do nothing (already at home)

### 2. âœ… Settings Close Button Working
- **Test**: Click the "Close" button in settings â†’ Should navigate away
- **Debug**: Check console for event dispatch and handling logs

### 3. âœ… Consistent Fixed Bottom UI
- **Settings**: Close button (left) + Save Settings button (right) - fixed at bottom
- **Documentation**: Close button (left) - fixed at bottom  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Close button (left) - fixed at bottom
- **All views**: Buttons are fixed and don't move when scrolling

## Test Instructions

1. **Open Settings**: Toolbar icon, View menu, or `Cmd+,`
2. **Test Close Button**: Click "Close" in settings - should work and return to notebook
3. **Test Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+W` - should work from any view
4. **Test Fixed UI**: Scroll in settings/docs - buttons should stay fixed at bottom
5. **Check Consistency**: All views should have same button placement and style

## Expected Behavior

- Close buttons work and navigate properly
- UI is consistent across all views
- Fixed bottom bars don't scroll away
